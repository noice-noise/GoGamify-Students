            The core vision of the platform is to help teachers and students
            have an educational platform where they can easily integrate
            game-mechanics and fun in both teaching and learning. Applying the
            element of fun and games in this todayâ€™s digital age should be easy
            and seamless for users. **GoGamify** can be used as a supplementary
            platform for existing software infrastructures like Learning
            Management Systems, Learning Portals, or Learning Libraries. Since
            the platform is designed to help provide solution to the needs,
            challenges, and use cases of teachers and students, the two
            progressive web applications were designed with features relevant to
            differing types of users.
